Start with : sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev

The above command is required if you want to install Speaker module, as per mentioned in it's documentation.

Now, install the package :

npm install

Copy any song in the folder, or enter the directory, or just type "bezerk.mp3"

Don't know it will work or not! :sad:

Moreover, there are no controller provided, you can just play the song and nothing more. The only way to 
close it is using command - CTRL + C
