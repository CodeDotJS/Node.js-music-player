# Node.js-music-player
a music player written in node [ cli ]

It's not my code, I read it somewhere, and it came in my mind.

I haven't tested the code yet.

Start with : sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev


If you are using Linux, then before testing this code, just type that command.

Now, install the package :

npm install

Copy any song in the folder.

Don't know it will work or not! :sad:
