Start with : sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev

The above command is required if you want to install Speaker module, as per mentioned in it's documentation.

--

Now, install the package, just run :

- npm install

speaker module can create problem and you won't able to install it, so use the above command to install it properly.

--

Copy any song in the folder, or enter the directory, or just type 

- node mplayer.js "bezerk.mp3"

--

Unfortunately, there are no controllers provided, you can just play the song and nothing more. The only way to 
close it is using command - CTRL + C
